# Mechatronics Projects – Class Portfolio

Welcome to my Mechatronics course project repository.

This repository contains a collection of hardware–software integration projects developed as part of my Mechatronics coursework. These projects combine embedded systems, control logic, sensor integration, and electromechanical actuation.

## 👩‍🚀 About Me

My name is **Candela Solis Zampini**.

I am currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering** with a concentration in **Dynamics, Robotics, and Controls**.

I previously completed a degree in **Astrobiology**, and my academic interests bridge:

- Mechatronics
- Robotics
- Embedded Systems
- Control Systems
- Space Technology
- Electromechanical System Design

I enjoy building systems that integrate hardware, software, and control logic into cohesive functional prototypes.
